 > Before I begin answering the questions below, I will start by saying that this was a difficult week for me.  I found myself feeling overwhelmed, mentally exhausted, and confused at times.  At the end of the week I asked myself, what went wrong?  
 > I think the biggest issue is my note taking methods; there is too much detail.  The second problem is knowing when to ask for help.  By the time I realized I should reach out for help, I would come up with excuses for why I shouldn't.  Some of the things that ran through my mind were: "You are so close to figuring this out", "It is too late to ask for help", and "You don't even know what to ask help for".  On the bright side, I am confident that I can overcome these obstacles and look forward to the day when these are no longer a concern.


## What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
> The thing that held me back the most this week was probably the bootstrap material.  I understood the concept of having columns nested inside of rows which are then nested inside of a container; however, manipulating those elements is difficult for me.  As a result, anything requiring bootstrap took me much longer to complete even the most basic change.
> I have been asking myself why this is the case and I believe there are a few reasons.  First, it is a new tool that I have never used and second, I had difficulty navigating W3 Schools and Bootstrap webpages to find what I was attempting to do.  I hope to revisit these concepts over the weekened and maybe even find new resources.
  
## What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

## How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
> I was concerned that the in-person leg of this journey would be difficult for many reasons.  I was surprised how I felt at the end of the week though.  Working in-person took away some of the anxiety I feel about asking questions and I have developed connections that would not have been possible working remotely.  The main thing that drew me into Awesome Inc. was the overwhelming positivity of the team and students**********
> I have already went through phases of asking myself if I could really get through this program and I am sure I will face doubt in the future.  But, it******************

## What is your “Why”?
> If the challenge was material related I would typically look up additional resources or sometimes it was nice to watch a video explanation.  That being said, there were definitely times when I should have leaned more heavily on the help channel.
