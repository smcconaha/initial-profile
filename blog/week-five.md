## What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
> The thing that held me back the most this week was probably the bootstrap material.  I understood the concept of having columns nested inside of rows which are then nested inside of a container; however, manipulating those elements is difficult for me.  As a result, anything requiring bootstrap took me much longer to complete even the most basic change.
> I have been asking myself why this is the case and I believe there are a few reasons.  First, it is a new tool that I have never used and second, I had difficulty navigating W3 Schools and Bootstrap webpages to find what I was attempting to do.  I hope to revisit these concepts over the weekend and maybe even find new resources.
  
## What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
> I would like to have a better understanding of when it is appropriate to define a method as a key: value pair within an object.  I don't fully understand the reason for doing this yet.  This is one of many things that I plan to research further when time allows.
  
## How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
> I was concerned that the in-person leg of this journey would be difficult for many reasons.  Though I was surprised how I felt at the end of the first in-person week.  Working in-person took away some of the anxiety I feel about asking for help or admitting that I don't understand the material.
> Another major difference is the connections that I have developed that otherwise wouldn't have been possible working remotely.  I feel like I am officially part of something and there is a real sense of community and friendship. 

## What is your “Why”?
> The reason why I do this is for myself and my family.  Previously I had a stable job that paid well and had good benefits; however, I was not happy.  Realizing that my struggles were impacting my family was a tough pill to swallow, but I eventually came to the conclusion that I could make a change.
> I look forward to seeing what I will accomplish in this bootcamp and the person that emerges on the other side.
