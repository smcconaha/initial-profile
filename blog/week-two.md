## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
> For now I would really like to be able to create a nice looking website from scratch.  I know I can make something now but it isn't visually appealing.  There are so many components and currently I don't have "the eye" or possess the abilities to create something stylish.  However, I am hopeful that I can develope those skills in time.
>
## What are you struggling with?
> I am really struggling with the amount of time required to cover the material.  I write detailed notes and it is sometimes hard for me to differentiate the important material from the material that will come in time.  I am sure that quality compounds the problem.
>
## How do you solve a problem?
>When it comes to problem solving, I like to fully understand the issue before I go into fix mode.  A good example is if I am working on a car I don't just grab a wrench and go to town.  I will do a test drive, visual inspection, and/or pull out some sort of diagnostic tool before starting work. I look at most other problems the same way, figure out what is wrong and then come up with a plan to repair or replace it.  I am also probably slower than most, but I am methodical and walk away knowing it was done correctly.

## What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
>I am stubborn and when it comes to getting stuck I have been known to rack my brain for far too long before changing my strategy.  Often I find it best to walk away from the issue and clear my head.  Sometimes I can come up with creative solutions or at least reduce the emotional charge. I also like to see how other people have solved similar situations and that can mean talking with someone about being stuck.
