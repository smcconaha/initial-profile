## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
> It is interesting to see the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  A good comparison would be the Ford Model-T, which originally was a no frills transportation method that only came in one color, black.  Then Ford started to focus on appearance by offering body and interior color options as well as appearance trim packages.  So now you can get from point A to B in style but what about air conditioning, self dimming headlights, windshield washers?  Those came down the line and that functionality became important for auto manufacturers to consider if they wanted to stay in business.  
> HTML is that bare-bones structure that can likely get you where you need to go on it's own, but we can add style with CSS and make it more attractive.  That is a great place to be in but then JavaScript takes it a step further by allowing you to add functionality.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all play an integral role in the user experience.

## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
> I would consider the header and body of each blog to be individual objects or on a larger scale, the pages (i.e., index, weekone, weektwo, and this file).  I can imagine writing script for these items in order to add depth.
>
>I suppose I could also think in terms of some of subjects like, my favorite things.  So an example would be:
```
const myFavoriteThings = {
  coffeeShops: ['Brevede', 'Manchester Coffee Company'],
  hobbies: ['wood carving', 'painting', 'rebuilding lanters', 'hiking', 'making coffee'],
  weatherType: 'rain'
};
```

## What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
> I used to wondered how someone could convert an idea or even a customer requirement into code.  It always seemed like such an intimidating process, but now I can see a little more clearly with pseudocode.  I can see value in the process and look forward to learning better techniques.
