Today I created a blog and it has been a bit more challenging that I anticipated.  I intend to add some pictures in time so stay tooned.  

Some other things that I learned include the following:
- How to initiate a pull request on GitHub.  This feature allows teams to work together and discuss changes without worrying about overwriting someone else's work.
- How the release based workflow operates.  This is used to package and provide software to users at a particular point in time.  The directions seemed a bit rushed for this part of the lesson and I would like to research this further.
- The ways you can track history on a commit, issue, or pull request.  This includes the secure hashtag algorithm (SHA).
- The differences between markup and markdown languages.
- That "git blame" :laughing: is used to show revision history as well as the last author to modify a line of a file.
