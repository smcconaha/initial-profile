 > Before I begin answering the questions below, I will start by saying that this was a difficult week for me.  I found myself feeling overwhelmed, mentally exhausted, and confused at times.  At the end of the week I asked myself, what went wrong?  
 > I think the biggest issue is my note taking methods; there is too much detail.  The second problem is knowing when to ask for help.  By the time I realized I should reach out for help, I would come up with excuses for why I shouldn't.  Some of the things that ran through my mind were: "You are so close to figuring this out", "It is too late to ask for help", and "You don't even know what to ask help for".  On the bright side, I am confident that I can overcome these obstacles and look forward to the day when these are no longer a concern.


## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
> The thing I found most useful was the daily stand-ups.  When I first learned that we were doing stand-ups, I had flashbacks of my previous job where we had daily stand-ups while working remotely.  Honestly, I had a bit of a bad taste in my mouth prior to this because it felt more like the boss checking in on everyone.  
> I was glad to see that these stand-ups where different and that we had a platform to discuss our challenges and things that we learned.  Stand-ups were beneficial and forever changed my way of thinking.
  
## What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
> The thing that hindered me the most is my study methods.  I have a difficult time understanding what is important in the material or to be more specific, it all seems important.  So I end up taking notes on every little thing, writing exampled, and then playing with the code (if applicable).  It definitely concerns me that on most weeks I put in around 50-60 hours on the material.
> Another thing that hindered me was differentiating a challenge from a blocker and knowing when to walk away.  Thirty minutes of failing to understand the issue could result in hours spent trying to figure out what I am doing wrong.  That certainly rang true this week and I am hopeful that I can overcome this issue in person.
  
## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
> If the challenge was material related I would typically look up additional resources or sometimes it was nice to watch a video explanation.  That being said, there were definitely times when I should have leaned more heavily on the help channel.
> I also felt some of the challenges associated with imposter syndrome.  When those thoughts occur I would usually try to refocus with medidation or mindfulness and then think about the person I would be after the program.  One of my favorite authors, Thich Nhat Hanh, has a book called *No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming Suffering* and I drew a lot of wisdom from that.  Essentially, through mindfulness we can embrace difficulties, realize they are temporary, and come out the other side stronger.
