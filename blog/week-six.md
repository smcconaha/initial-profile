## What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?
> This week I learned about the interactions between websites and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  Chris Hoffman wrote an article on howtogeek titled ["What is an API?"](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/), that explained in simple terms the usefulness of APIs.  I had never considered the amount of work that developers would be responsible for if they could not rely on APIs.
  
## What does it mean to develop good code?
> Developing good code means providing a well-thought-out solution that is both flexible and abstract in a way that allows it to be useful in the future.  This is opposed to code that is rigid, difficult to maintain, and/or code that has limited potential.
  
## What does it mean to be a good developer?
> Being a good developer means laying out a detailed plan for how you will accomplish the end user's needs while being mindful of project scope.  It means writing good code that is legible and well-thought-out as mentioned in above.  Another key to being a good developer is continuously honing your skills in order to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry.

## What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
> This is a difficult question to answer because I do not feel like I have earned the title of programmer.  However, on multiple occasions I have witnessed creative and talented individuals being dialed back to providing a solution that barely meets the requirements due to budgetary concerns or timeline.  I imagine that programmers hate being put in this type of situation and being forced to limit product quality.  
> I feel like this is something I can relate to right now because I want to provide solution "X" but only have time to provide solution "Y".  Timeline is still a major concern but instead of a monetary budget I am restricted by my knowledge base and mental fortitude.
