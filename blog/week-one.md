## Was your first week what you expected?  Why?  Why not?
> I came into the first week expecting the course load to be challenging; however, I did not anticipate needing so much time to learn the tools like GitHub and GitPod.  I realize that I can be a slow learner, especially if the subject is brand new, so this really isn't that surprising.
>
> These are a few of the interesting things I learned about today:
> - How to initiate a pull request on GitHub.  This feature allows teams to work together and discuss changes without worrying about overwriting someone else's work.
> - How the release based workflow operates.  This is used to package and provide software to users at a particular point in time.  The directions seemed a bit rushed for this part of the lesson and I would like to research this further.
> - The ways you can track history on a commit, issue, or pull request.  This includes the secure hashtag algorithm (SHA).
> - The differences between markup and markdown languages.
> - That "git blame" :laughing: is used to show revision history as well as the last author to modify a line of a file.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
> I am eager to learn more about command line interface (CLI).  I have played around with CLI on my computer as well as a few test environments but this weekend I plan to dig in a little further and break some things.

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
> I have a lot of hobbies and interests which makes it hard to narrow down the list but here goes.  I enjoy experimenting with different types of art as well as drawing and painting.  I took up wood carving roughly two years ago and have included pictures of one of my wood spirit carvings.  From time to time I also like to pick up figurines from Goodwill and paint them to look like zombies.  Sometimes I will even snag an old print and add my own spin on it.
